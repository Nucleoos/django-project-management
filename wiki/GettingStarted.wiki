#summary Getting Started with django-project-management

= Creating a new project =

At the moment projects are created using the admin interface rather than the front-end.

Go to your admin section and click the *Add* link next to *Projects*

You will be asked to provide the following information:

|| *Field* || *Description* ||
|| Project Name || A short name for your project. Max of 255 characters, must be unique ||
|| Project Status || Choose which status the project is in ||
|| Company || Which company the project is being run for. You can add new Companys from the admin interface ||
|| Project Manager || Which Django user is the project manager for this project ||
|| Project Number || A number or code for this project. Must be unique and is used heavily in the URLs. This was included because we have a finance code for each project we run ||
|| Duration Type || Choice of either days or hours. In the Work Breakdown Structure do we use days or hours to measure task duration ||
|| Project Sponsor || A free text field to name the Sponsor of the project ||
|| Read ACL || Which Django group is allowed read access to the project ||
|| Write ACL || Which Django group is allowed write access to the project ||

===IMPORTANT===
django-project-management was designed to be used in a multi-company, multi-team environment. For this reason if you don't have read access to a project you won't see it in the front end, even if you are the project manager or a Django admin.
